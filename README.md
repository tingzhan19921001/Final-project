# Monte Carlo Simulation Scenario & Purpose:

Scenario: 
In this project, we are trying to simulate the daily profit made by a local supermarket. The supermarket we refer to are markets like Meijer or Walmart. In our daily life, we go to shopping in supermarkets at least once a week or more. Predicting the daily profit in different situations helps the supermarkets to prepare well.

Here we adopt a top down method to predict daily supermarket profit. 
First we start with: Profit = Income - Expenses. It is true that both income and expense will change on daily basis, especially holiday season vs non-holiday season. Just like the past Thanksgiving holiday and the coming Christmas holiday, the profit is tremendously from other days.

Therefore, we have separated into two situations when predicting the profit: Holiday vs Non-Holiday.

Secondly, as in real world, the income comes from the accumulation of each transaction. Therefore, 
Income = Number of Sales(S) * Profit per Sale(P)


### Hypothesis before running the simulation:
1. Income and Expense are independent. The calculation of income will not be influenced by expense.
2. The profit per sale is calculated by 

### Simulation's variables of uncertainty
List and describe your simulation's variables of uncertainty (where you're using pseudo-random number generation). 
For each such variable, how did you decide the range and which probability distribution to use?  
Do you think it's a good representation of reality?
